# ‚öôÔ∏è Applying AI for Equipment Logs

## üß≠ Overview
**Applying AI for Equipment Logs** is a Microsoft Power Automate project designed to automate the extraction and analysis of data from structured equipment log sheets uploaded to SharePoint. The extracted data is then stored in Excel and visualized through a Power BI dashboard embedded within the **Quattrofy** web application. This project supports decision-making on equipment maintenance vs. replacement by identifying service costs over time.

---

## üí° Idea & Concept
The purpose of this project is to eliminate manual entry and improve reporting accuracy for equipment maintenance logs. By leveraging AI Builder in Power Platform, structured documents (equipment logs) are analyzed, and key service and cost data are extracted to support business intelligence efforts.

This initiative was built as part of Quattro Constructors‚Äô digital transformation strategy to better monitor asset health and reduce long-term operational costs.
